Aside from this value of the\nstudy of Greek architecture as a means to establishing artistic\nprinciples for construction in general, it should also be remembered that multitudes of modern buildings exhibit Greek construction or employ Greek details that these details are often\nmisused and corrupted, and that a study of the original forms\nis essential to the criticism of such misuses and corruptions.\nSuch study is also essential to comprehension of the matter-ofThis point has,\nfact history of modern architectural styles.\nhowever, been developed sufficiently by the author of the\ncompendium of Greek architecture.\nI have so far emphasized the importance of the studies\nfurthered by this book as being a branch of history, because it\nis a common thing to consider the Greeks as having had a\nspecial aptitude for \""art,\"" with implication of corresponding\ndeficiencies in other fields of life whereas the fact is that their\nart represents their aptitudes, character, and life in general.\nLet me finish my preface by pointing out that all book\nstudies of Greek art, and all reading about Greek art, or any\nother art, are the very least part of the matter in hand, which\nis to know the monuments themselves.\nAll books on the subject are purely a means to this end.

By a knowledge\nof the actual objects I understand, however, a knowledge of\nphotographs, casts, and models of them. Book engravings\nare inadequate because they cannot possibly represent the\nmultitude of objects, and because they lack the veracity of\nphotographs and casts. Every possible access to the various\ncast collections which are being so numerously founded in this\ncountry is an indispensable accompaniment to the study of\nthis book. In default of such access it must be said that\n\nphotographs will very ably make good this deficiency, but\nthat contact at least with abundant photographic illustration\nis really indispensable.\nI should therefore define the practical\naim of this book to be that of bringing the reader in contact\nwith photographs or casts of Greek sculpture, and to be that\nof bringing the reader in contact with models and casts and\nphotographs of Greek architecture.

The statement that \"" Greek architecture did not include the arch\"" is qualified by the recent discovery of two\ncases of the arch in Greece which date back to the early period\nhere under consideration. These discoveries would make it\npossible or probable that the customary view that Greek architecture ignored the arch may be owing to the destruction of\nthe monuments in which it occurred. It is undoubtedly true\nthat the arch construction was never employed in temples.\nEgyptian architecture employed the arch in utilitarian construction, although it is never found in the temples, and\ninstances are known at Thebes dating to the XVIII.

The implication that the remains of Mycenae and\nOrchomenos belong to Greek art indicates the belief of all\nstudents on this point, down to a very recent date.
