## Notebook 2: Classification and translation of cuneiform tablets using Machine Learning

 Cuneiform is one of the world’s oldest writing systems, invented by Sumerian scribes around 3200 BCE in what is now southern-Iraq. Over time, the writing system was adapted to write multiple languages and covered diverse content, such a economic transactions, songs, legal decrees, and even prescriptions (). Using machine learning, we can identify patterns in the contents of cuneiform tablets, and uncover how those patterns evolve across regions and time.
